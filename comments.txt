# 🔐 CREATIVE JOB TRACKER – CONTEXT SNAPSHOT (SAFE HANDOVER)

## PURPOSE
This snapshot preserves the full technical, functional, and UX context of the Creative Job Tracker so development can continue immediately in a new chat without rediscovery, refactoring, or logic loss.

---

## 1️⃣ WHAT THIS SYSTEM IS

Creative Job Tracker is an internal **service request orchestration platform**, not just a creative tool.

• Users submit job requests  
• Service departments process them (Traffic implemented first)  
• Jobs follow a controlled lifecycle  
• Assignments, files, and activity are fully tracked  

Traffic is the first service provider, but the architecture is designed to scale to HR, IT, Finance, etc.

---

## 2️⃣ CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS (COMPLETED)

### CORE FEATURES
✔ Authentication + session guard  
✔ Role-based access (USER, TRAFFIC, DESIGNER, ADMIN, EXECUTIVE)  
✔ Secure job creation, update, delete  
✔ Job locking after dispatch  
✔ Status lifecycle:

✔ Activity logging  
✔ UUID-based file upload system  
✔ File cleanup on update and delete  
✔ Toast notifications (create / update / delete)  
✔ UX polished (no forced reloads except final refresh)  
✔ Strong validation rules

## 3️⃣ USER DASHBOARD – FINAL BEHAVIOR

### FILTERS
• Default view: current month only  
• Search + date range filter  
• Filter bar is sticky and always visible  
• Table header is sticky  
• Row count shown above table header  

### TABLE COLUMN ORDER (FINAL – DO NOT CHANGE)
1. Job Code  
2. Client  
3. Project  
4. Job Subject  
5. Received At  
6. Due Date  
7. Assigned Designer  
8. Status  
9. Actions  

### TABLE UX
• Black header with white bold text  
• Alternating row colors (white / light cyan)  
• Hover disabled where required  
• Action column vertically aligned (no shifting on multi-line content)  
• Slide-down details take full table width  
• Expanding one job collapses others automatically  

---

## 4️⃣ JOB DETAILS SLIDE-DOWN (EXPANDED VIEW)

### BEHAVIOR
• Full-width expansion under job row  
• Only one job expanded at a time  
• Professional grid-based layout  

### CONTENT SHOWN
• Job Code  
• Client  
• Project  
• Job Subject (replaces status in details view)  
• Received At  
• Due Date  
• Assigned Designer (if dispatched or later)  
• Full Brief  
• Reference link (clickable, placeholder supported)  
• Completed work link (only when status = RELEASED)  

### VISIBILITY RULES
• User sees completed work ONLY when status = RELEASED  
• Designer name visible from DISPATCHED onward  

---

## 5️⃣ FILE UPLOAD SYSTEM (PRO-GRADE)

### STORAGE
• Disk filename: UUID.ext  
• Database stores: UUID.ext only  
• Upload size enforced (≤ 1MB)  

### LIFECYCLE
• Old file deleted on update  
• File deleted from storage on job delete  
• Safe unlink logic (no broken paths)  

---

## 6️⃣ DATABASE STATUS

• Fully relational schema  
• Foreign keys enforced  
• Tables include:
  - users  
  - roles  
  - departments  
  - job_orders  
  - job_status  
  - job_assignments  
  - activity_logs  

• Seeded with 50+ test jobs  
• Status logic verified  
• Department constraints respected  

⚠️ Full SQL schema + seed data will be pasted in the new chat.

---

## 7️⃣ CRITICAL BUSINESS RULES (DO NOT BREAK)

• Users can edit/delete ONLY when status = NEW  
• Received info cannot be cleared once set  
• Assigned designer shown only after dispatch  
• Completed work shown only after release  
• Filters do not affect permissions  
• UI changes must never alter logic  

---

## 8️⃣ NEXT PHASES (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)

### TRAFFIC DASHBOARD
• Department queue  
• Assignment logic  
• Release control  

### MULTI-DEPARTMENT EXPANSION
• HR / IT / Finance as service providers  
• Same job engine, department-specific workflows  
• Service-based routing  

### FUTURE IDEAS (DISCUSSED)
• Project-based Gantt chart (feasible)  
• SLA tracking  
• Cross-department analytics  
• Approval chains

## 🔁 HOW TO START THE NEW CHAT

Use this message:

“This is a continuation of the Creative Job Tracker project.
I’m pasting the full context snapshot, database SQL, and key files.
Please resume development without changing existing logic or UX.”

Then paste:
1) This snapshot
2) SQL file
3) Files listed above

## FINAL NOTE

This system is already enterprise-grade.
Traffic is only the first service provider.
Scaling to HR / IT / Finance will be evolution, not rewrite.

Next logical step: Traffic dashboard architecture.
